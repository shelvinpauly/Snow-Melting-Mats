# Snow Melting Mat 

This project involved designing and simulating a heating mat to melt snow accumulation on vehicle rooftops. The goal was to develop a portable, durable, and energy-efficient solution.

## Design

- Heating element made of high resistivity Nichrome wire wrapped in graphite sheet 
- Insulating fiberglass layer below heating element
- Load cell and Arduino to detect snow and activate heating
- Lightweight, flexible, and weatherproof outer casing

## Analysis 

- Calculated resistance and power rating needed for snow melting
- Simulated heat transfer in ANSYS for different snow types and conditions
- Heating element rating of 800W sufficient to melt 2.5 inch snow layer 

## Features

- Automated snow detection and activation reduces energy usage
- Durable construction and waterproofing for outdoor operation
- Simple plug-in operation and lightweight for portability

## Conclusion

- Simulations successfully proved snow melting capability under different conditions
- Load sensing and modularity allow for further optimization and enhancements 
- Overall, designed an effective prototype snow melting mat for vehicles
